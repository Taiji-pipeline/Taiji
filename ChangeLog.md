Latest
======

- Auto-detect effective genome size for MACS2.

- Compress BAM files generated by BWA.

- Reduce memory usage in certain steps.

- Add more features to single cell RNA-seq analysis pipeline.

- Add more features to single cell ATAC-seq analysis pipeline.

v1.0.1 (2019-10-14)
===================

This release introduces a lot of new functions, performance improvements and 
bug fixes.

- Use promoter accessibility to estimate the gene expression when RNA-seq is
  not available. This greately improves the results.

- New interface for Parallelism and distributed computing which supports running
  jobs on PBS or slurm. The number of jobs and resource usage of each step can now
  be configured.

- Add more QCs and visualization, including fragment size distribution, TSS enrichment,
  signal correlation and so on.

- Preliminary support for single cell RNA and ATAC analysis.

v0.5.0 (2018-10-28)
===================

- Add a function to include external networks, using the field
  `external_network` in the configuration file.
